# Moken DApp

## Building

To build the application, run the following command:

```shell
docker buildx bake -f docker-bake.hcl -f docker-bake.override.hcl --load
```

## Running

To start the application, execute the following command:

```shell
docker compose up
```

The application can afterwards be shut down with the following command:

```shell
docker compose down -v
```

## Deploying to a testnet

Deploying the application to a blockchain requires creating a smart contract on that network, as well as running a validator node for the DApp.

The first step is to build the DApp's back-end machine, which will produce a hash that serves as a unique identifier.

```shell
docker buildx bake -f docker-bake.hcl -f docker-bake.override.hcl machine --load
```

Once the machine docker image is ready, we can use it to deploy a corresponding Rollups smart contract. This requires you to define a few environment variables to specify which network you are deploying to, which account to use, and which RPC gateway to use when submitting the deploy transaction.

```shell
export NETWORK=<network>
export MNEMONIC=<user sequence of twelve words>
export RPC_URL=<https://your.rpc.gateway>
```

For example, to deploy to the Goerli testnet using an Alchemy RPC node, you could execute:

```shell
export NETWORK=goerli
export MNEMONIC=<user sequence of twelve words>
export RPC_URL=https://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/<USER_KEY>
```

With that in place, you can submit a deploy transaction to the Cartesi DApp Factory contract on the target network by executing the following command:

```shell
DAPP_NAME=moken-dapp docker compose -f ./deploy-testnet.yml up
```

This will create a file at `./deployments/<network>/moken-dapp.json` with the deployed contract's address.
Once the command finishes, it is advisable to stop the docker compose and remove the volumes created when executing it.

```shell
DAPP_NAME=moken-dapp docker compose -f ./deploy-testnet.yml down -v
```

After that, a corresponding Cartesi Validator Node must also be instantiated in order to interact with the deployed smart contract on the target network and handle the back-end logic of the DApp.
Aside from the environment variables defined above, the node will also need a secure websocket endpoint for the RPC gateway (WSS URL) and the chain ID of the target network.

For example, for Goerli and Alchemy, you would set the following additional variables:

```shell
export WSS_URL=wss://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/<USER_KEY>
export CHAIN_ID=5
```

Then, the node itself can be started by running a docker compose as follows:

```shell
DAPP_NAME=mydapp docker compose -f ./docker-compose-testnet.yml -f ./docker-compose.override.yml up
```

## Interacting with the deployed application

With the node running, you can interact with the deployed DApp using the [frontend-console](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/tree/main/frontend-console), as described [previously](#interacting-with-the-application).
This time, however, you need to specify the appropriate connectivity configurations.

First of all, in the separate terminal for the frontend-console, define the `MNEMONIC` and `RPC_URL` variables as before:

```shell
export MNEMONIC=<user sequence of twelve words>
export RPC_URL=<https://your.rpc.gateway>
```

Then, inputs can be sent by specifying the DApp contract's address, as follows:

```shell
yarn start input send --payload "Hello there" --addressFile path/to/moken-dapp/deployments/<network>/moken-dapp.json
```

Resulting notices can then be retrieved by querying the local Cartesi Node, as before:

```shell
yarn start notice list
```
